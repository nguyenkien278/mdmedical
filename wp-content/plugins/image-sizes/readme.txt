So, it creates multiple sizes of an image while uploading? Here is the solution!

== Description ==

By default, WordPress creates 4 additional sizes (thumbnail, medium, medium-large and large) of an image while uploading. But your theme and/or plugin(s) may create more sizes. And it's really a headache when you are considering your storage.

Let's show you a solution to get rid of this. Just choose which of the sizes you want to be prevented from creating, and it won't be happening!

== Installation ==

1. Upload \`image-sizes\` to the \`/wp-content/plugins/\` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to settings page and choose which of the sizes you want to be prevented from creating.

== Screenshots ==

1. Choose image sizes to be prevented from creating.
